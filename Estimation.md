# Estimation approach

## Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |       50 classes                     |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |         200 LOC/class                  | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 10,000 LOC|
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |             1,000 ph                         |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | â‚¬ 30,000| 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |     6.25 calendar weeks               |               

## Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|         Component name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
|Requirement document    | 130 ph |
| GUI prototype | 70 ph|
|Design document | 100 ph|
|Code |350 ph|
| Unit tests |200 ph|
| API tests |150 ph|
| Management documents  |70 ph|



## Estimate by activity decomposition
### 
|         Activity name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
| | |

## Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| Estimate by size |1,000 ph| 6.25 calendar weeks |
| Estimate by product decomposition | 1,070 ph | 6.8 calendar weeks |

# Instructions

The design must satisfy the Official Requirements document, notably functional and non functional requirements, and be consistent with the APIs

# High level design 

<discuss architectural styles used, if any>
- client/server
- 3 tier (DATABASE)??? / model-view

## Front End
The front end, which contains the GUI, is externally provided.  
Hence, we will not focus on it.

## Back End
The back end is further divided into 3 different packages:
- Warehouse, which is used as a fa√ßade by the front end
- Model, containing all classes needed to manage and process data
- Exceptions, to handle any incorrect action triggered either by a user or the system itself


# Low level design

<for each package in high level design, report class diagram. Each class should detail attributes and operations>









# Verification traceability matrix

\<for each functional requirement from the requirement document, list which classes concur to implement it>











# Verification sequence diagrams 
\<select key scenarios from the requirement document. For each of them define a sequence diagram showing that the scenario can be implemented by the classes and methods in the design>
